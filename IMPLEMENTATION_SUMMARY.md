# WasteWise - Marketplace & Dynamic Pricing Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of three major features in the WasteWise application:
1. **Dynamic Pricing System** - Calculates waste value based on type, quantity, and market rates
2. **Price Estimation in Booking** - Shows users cost/value breakdown before booking
3. **Marketplace Platform** - OLX-style platform for listing and booking waste

---

## 1. Dynamic Pricing System

### Location: `backend/utils/pricing.py`

### Features Implemented:
- **Market-based waste valuation** with subtype support
- **Collection cost calculation** with GST
- **Net transaction calculation** (value - cost)
- **Multi-item price breakdown**

### Pricing Structure:

#### Waste Market Rates (per kg):
```python
Plastic: â‚¹6-15/kg (varies by subtype: PET bottles, HDPE, PVC, etc.)
Paper: â‚¹6-10/kg (newspaper, cardboard, office paper, etc.)
Metal: â‚¹20-400/kg (aluminum, steel, copper, brass, iron)
Glass: â‚¹1.5-2/kg (clear, colored, mixed)
E-waste: â‚¹15-200/kg (mobile phones, laptops, batteries, etc.)
Organic: â‚¹0/kg (composting service)
```

#### Collection Charges:
- Base Pickup Charge: â‚¹30
- Collection Fee: â‚¹3-15/kg (varies by waste type)
- Distance Charge: â‚¹2/km (beyond 5km)
- GST: 18%
- Minimum Booking: â‚¹50

### Key Functions:
1. `calculate_waste_value()` - Calculates market value of waste
2. `calculate_collection_cost()` - Calculates service collection charges
3. `calculate_net_transaction()` - Net amount (earning or payment)
4. `get_price_breakdown()` - Multi-item breakdown
5. `get_waste_subtypes()` - Available subtypes with rates

## 2. Enhanced Booking Form with Price Estimation

### Location: `frontend/src/components/BookingForm.js`

### New Features:
- **Real-time price calculation** as user enters quantity
- **Waste subtype selection** with rates displayed
- **Detailed cost breakdown** showing:
  - Market value of waste (+ amount)
  - Collection charges breakdown
  - GST calculation
  - Net amount (earning/payment)
- **Clear messaging** about whether user earns or pays

### User Experience:
```
Example: 50kg of PET Bottles
---------------------------
Waste Value:       + â‚¹750  (â‚¹15/kg Ã— 50kg)
Collection Charges:
  Base Charge:       â‚¹30
  Collection Fee:    â‚¹250   (â‚¹5/kg Ã— 50kg)
  GST (18%):        â‚¹50.40
  Total Cost:       â‚¹330.40
---------------------------
Net Amount:        + â‚¹419.60

âœ“ You will earn money from this waste!
Amount will be credited after collection.
```

### CSS Enhancements:
- Color-coded pricing (green for earnings, red for payments)
- Highlighted value badges
- Responsive design for mobile
